## Practical 8

This practical is concerned with implementing both an iterative and recursive version of an algorithm.

The algorithm is Euclid's Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) algorithm.

##### File Contents
This practical only contains the *iter_recur.c* file.
In this file both an iterative and recursive implementation of Euclid's GCD algorithm are included and applied to 
two user defined integers.
