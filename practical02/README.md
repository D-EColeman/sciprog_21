## Practical 2

This practical is concerned with creating simple programs and to highlight the difference in number representations in C and differences due to floating point arithmetic.


##### File Contents
This practical contains two files.

The file *Conversion.c* contains the code which converts a number to its integer representation, floating point number representation and its binary representation.

The file *Sum.c* contains the code which shows the difference between two differently coded but mathematically equivalent sums.


The above code, when compiled and run, shows first how numbers are actually treated by the machine, and more importantly, how carefuly consideration is required when working with said number.
