## Practical 9

This practical is concerned with implementing a program for checking whether a user inputted or file read matrix is a magic square.


##### File Contents
This practical contains numerous files.

The file *magic_square.h* was provided beforehand. Its purpose is to find whether the matrix is a magic number.
The file *magic_square.txt* is a test file containing a 3x3 matrix of the numbers 1-9, used for testing the file reading program.

The file *magic.c* contains the code implementation which takes in a **user defined matrix** as it is running.
The file *file_magic.c* contains the code implementation which **reads in from a file**.
Both of these output wheter a matrix is a magic square or not.
